/*
  ...........YOUR MISSION...........

  Write a program that will convert a temperature from
  fahrenheit to celsius, or from celsius to fahrenheit.

  In the HTML, have one input field where someone can enter
  in a temperature. Then have a radio button group where
  Celsius or Fahrenheit can be selected as the scale that the
  number should be converted to. Then a button that,
  when clicked, displays the converted.

  Since we haven't covered DOM events yet, I'll help you along
  with the button click.

function toCelsius () {

}

function toFahrenheit () {

}

// This function should determine which conversion should
// happen based on which radio button is selected.
function determineConverter (e) {

  // This will actually return an array containing both of the radio buttons
  // so you will need to look at each item in the array and see if the 'checked'
  // property is true (sample code provided)
  var optionChosen = document.getElementsByName("conversion_type");

  // for loop
    if (?.checked && ?.value === 'celsius') {

    }
  // end for loop
}

// Get a reference to the button element in the DOM
var button = document.getElementById("converter");

// Assign a function to be executed when the button is clicked
button.onclick = determineConverter;
