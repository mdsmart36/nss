/*
    Create an HTML file that contains a button
    and a div with any content you want. The
    background color of the div should be a color
    of your choosing.

    1. Using jQuery, write code that captures when
       the user clicks the button. When that happens,
       change the background color of the div.

    2. When the user clicks the button. Also add a new
       div element inside it with more content of
       your choice.

    3. Using jQuery, write code that captures when
       the user puts the mouse over the div, and then
       hides the div.
